# Automated Telescope Dust Cover

This repository contains code that allows you to build your own automated telescope dust cover. In particular, you will find:

* The code for the ASCOM driver (Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 project)
* The code for the Arduino firmware
* The various STL files to 3D print all the mechanical parts
* A blueprint for the electronic circuit

Here is a 3D rendering of all the parts involved in this project:

## Pre-Requisites

* A Windows computer (I know what you're thinking... The good news is that with [ASCOM Alpaca](https://www.ascom-standards.org/Developer/Alpaca.htm), we will soon have a truly multi-platform solution...)
* [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (FYI, I used the 2022 edition...)
* [ASCOM Platform](https://ascom-standards.org/)
* [ASCOM Platform Developer Components](https://ascom-standards.org/COMDeveloper/Index.htm)
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
* A 3D printer able to print PETG, and a slicer (I use a heavily upgraded Creality Ender 3 v2, and Ultimaker Cura)
* A few basic tools that any tinkerer must own...

## Hardware

The following are just suggestions... Also, over time, some of the Amazon links may no longer work... But it should help get you started.

## Compiling The ASCOM Driver

Open Microsoft Visual Studio as an administrator (right click on the Microsoft Visual Studio shortcut, and select "Run as administrator") This is required because when building the code, by default, Microsoft Visual Studio will register the necessary COM components, and this operation requires special privileges (Note: This is something you can disable in the project settings...) Then, open the solution (`ASCOM_Driver\ASCOM_Driver.sln`), change the solution configuration to `Release` (in the toolbar), open the `Build` menu and click on `Build ASCOM Driver`. As long as you have properly installed all the required dependencies, the build should succeed and the ASCOM driver will be registered on your system.

## Compiling The Arduino Firmware

* Add support for Seeeduino boards by following [the instructions from the board manufacturer](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/).
* To customize the name of the device when connected to your computer, open the file `boards.txt`, which, on my system and for the version of the Seeeduino board I am using, is located at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Arduino15\packages\Seeeduino\hardware\samd\1.8.2\boards.txt`. Then, change the value of the key `seeed_XIAO_m0.build.usb_product` from `Seeed XIAO M0` (default) to whatever you'd like.
* Finally, connect your Seeeduino board to your computer (make sure you use a USB-C cable that supports data and not just power!), open the sketch file located at `Arduino_Firmware\Arduino_Firmware.ino`, and click on the `Upload` button in the toolbar.
